📰 News Summarization & Sentiment Analysis with Hindi Text-to-Speech
This project fetches news articles, performs sentiment analysis, extracts key topics, and generates Hindi text-to-speech (TTS). It includes a Flask API (backend) and a Streamlit UI (frontend) for an interactive user experience.

📌 Features
✅ Fetch News → Retrieves articles from NewsAPI.
✅ Sentiment Analysis → Classifies news as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
✅ Topic Extraction → Identifies key topics using BERT embeddings.
✅ Hindi Text-to-Speech → Translates summaries and generates Hindi speech.
✅ Streamlit UI → Allows users to fetch news, analyze sentiment, and play/download audio.

📊 Model Details: NLP & ML Techniques Used
This project leverages pre-trained NLP models for sentiment analysis, topic extraction, and text-to-speech.

1️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (Supervised ML - VADER)
✔ Uses VADER Sentiment Analysis to classify news as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
✔ Rule-based model trained with lexicons of positive and negative words.

2️⃣ Topic Extraction (Unsupervised ML - KeyBERT)
✔ Uses BERT embeddings to extract top 3 topics from news summaries.
✔ Identifies key concepts discussed in articles.

3️⃣ Text-to-Speech (Deep Learning - Google TTS)
✔ Uses Google's TTS (Tacotron & WaveNet) for realistic speech synthesis.
✔ Converts translated Hindi text into an MP3 file.

4️⃣ Language Translation (Deep Learning - Google Translate API)
✔ Uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English-to-Hindi translation.

🖥️ API Development: How APIs Work
The backend is developed using Flask, exposing RESTful APIs for news fetching, sentiment analysis, and TTS generation.

1️⃣ Fetch News API
Endpoint: GET /fetch-news?company=company_name

Description: Retrieves news articles, analyzes sentiment, and extracts key topics.

Request Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch-news?company=apple"
Response Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Apple releases new MacBook",
      "summary": "Apple launched a new MacBook with AI features.",
      "sentiment": "Positive",
      "topics": ["MacBook", "AI features", "Apple Launch"]
    }
  ]
}
2️⃣ Generate Hindi Text-to-Speech API
Endpoint: POST /generate-tts

Description: Converts text to Hindi speech (MP3 file).

Request Example (Postman or cURL):

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-tts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"यह एक टेस्ट ऑडियो है।\"}"
Response: Returns an MP3 audio file (tts_output.mp3).

🌍 API Usage: Third-Party API Integrations
1️⃣ NewsAPI
Purpose: Fetches real-time news articles based on the company name.

Integration: Used in fetch_news() function inside utils.py.

2️⃣ Google Translate API
Purpose: Translates news summaries from English to Hindi before generating speech.

Integration: Used in translate_to_hindi() inside utils.py.

3️⃣ Google TTS (gTTS)
Purpose: Converts Hindi text into spoken audio (MP3 format).

Integration: Used in generate_hindi_audio() inside utils.py.

🔎 Assumptions & Limitations
Assumptions
✅ NewsAPI always returns at least 10 articles (may vary based on availability).
✅ Sentiment analysis is accurate for short texts (VADER is lexicon-based).
✅ Google Translate provides correct translations (but may have errors for complex sentences).
